# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
project for prodev alx to help understand the software development lifecycle moreso the requirement gathering part which is an essential stage in sdlc as here the developers interact with the stakeholders to gather more information on their requirements and get back to them with prototypes of the project to test if the system fits the users functional and non functional requirement.
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
System requirement analysis is important because of 5 main reasons: 
a) Clarity and understanding of the system.
b) Scope definition this clearly defines the system
c) Basis design and development
d) Cost and Time Estimation
e) Quality Assurance
# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
a) requirement gathering
b) requirement elicitation 
c) requirement documentation
d) requirement modelling
e) requirement validation
# Types of Requirements
  # Functional Requirements
  Functional requirements explain what the system should do. In the booking system the examples here are user authentication, booking system, and user registration. 
  # Non Functional Requirements
  These Requirements explain how the system should function
  Examples in the booking sytem case study include; the  booking system security and system performance.

# Acceptance Criteria 
Acceptance criteria is important for;
a) Ensuring all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
b) Providing a basis for testing and validation.
C) Helping in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
